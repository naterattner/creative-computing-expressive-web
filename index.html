            <h1>Star Spectrum</h1>
            <p>
                Our digital world yields remarkable power on its physical counterpart. Ratings on review websites such as Yelp influence where we eat, shop, play, and call for help.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beneath these aggregate star ratings often lies a range of personal experiences, with glowing five-star reviews left alongside scathing one-stars. Personal experiences can vary dramatically, and online platforms can bring out extreme viewpoints. But these digital reviews can shape a reader's perception of a place and sway how they spend their physical time. In many cases, that decision can be made simply by which review a reader sees first.

                This web installation displays an analysis of a <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset" target="_blank">Yelp dataset</a> covering more than 150,000 businesses and 6.9 million reviews. It includes businesses that received both five and one-star reviews within the most recent year of the dataset, from early 2021 through early 2022.
